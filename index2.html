    <img src="chocolate-cake-3.jpg" alt="Chocolate Cake" class="img2">
    Main ingredientsfor the batter are as follows:
   
  <ul>
      <li><p><b>All-Purpose Flour:</b> 2 cups (250 grams)<br>
         This is what provides the structure for the cake.
         As always, when measuring your flour make sure to use the spoon and level method. 
        Too much flour can lead to a dense cake instead of a soft, light, and fluffy cake.</p></li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Natural Unsweetened Cocoa Powder:</b>3/4 cup (65 grams)<br>
                This is what provides the chocolate flavor! I highly recommend using natural unsweetened
                 cocoa powder instead of Dutch-processed cocoa powder. 
                This will ensure that the cake has enough acidity in it to rise properly.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Baking Soda, Baking Powder, & Salt:</b> 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda,
                    1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and
                    1 teaspoon salt <br>
                I’ve tested this cake with varying levels of baking powder and 
                baking soda and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of each one is the perfect amount. 
                There’s also some salt to help balance out the sweetness.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Sugar:</b> 1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar and
                1 cup (200 grams) brown sugar<br>
                You’ll be using a mix of brown sugar and granulated sugar in this cake. 
                The brown sugar adds moisture to the cake as well.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Oil:</b> 1/2 cup (120ml) canola or vegetable oil
               <br>
                I recommend sticking with a neutral flavored oil like canola or vegetable oil.
                 Coconut oil will be fine too, but if you do use it,
                  just be sure your other ingredients are at room temperature 
                so that it doesn’t solidify when you mix everything together.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
               <b>Buttermilk:</b> 1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk <br>
               The buttermilk adds moisture and helps to create a tender crumb.
                If you don’t have any on hand, you can make your own with my homemade buttermilk 
                substitute.
 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
            <b>Eggs & Vanilla:</b> 2 large eggs and
            2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br>
            The eggs provide stability and the vanilla adds a little extra flavor.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Boiling Water & Espresso Powder:</b> 1 cup (240 ml) boiling water and 1 teaspoon instant espresso powder optional, but recommended<br>
                The boiling water helps to bloom the cocoa powder and create a deeper, richer chocolate flavor. 
                I also like to add some instant espresso powder which enhances the chocolate flavor even more. 
                You can omit the espresso powder, 
                but you’ll still want to add the boiling water if you do. 
            </p>
        </li>
    
  </ul> 
  <center><h2> Ingredients for the chocolate buttercream frosting</h2></center> 
  
  <ul>
      <li>
          <p>
              <b>Unsalted Butter:</b> 2 cups (460 grams) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature<br>
              This will give you a beautiful buttery flavor in your buttercream frosting. 
              I recommend sticking with unsalted butter for the frosting as well.

          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              <b>Powdered Sugar:</b> 6 cups (720 grams) powdered sugar<br>
              Also known as icing sugar or confectioner’s sugar 
              this helps to sweeten the frosting and make it thicker so
               you can frost your cake and pipe decorations. 
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              <b>Unsweetened Cocoa Powder:</b> 1 cup (90 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted <br>
              To add some chocolate flavor to the frosting. 
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              <b>Heavy Whipping Cream & Vanilla Extract:</b> 6-7 tablespoons (90-105 ml) heavy whipping cream <br>
              The heavy whipping cream helps to thin out the frosting just a bit so
               it’s easier to spread and pipe. If you don’t have any heavy whipping cream on hand,
                you can use milk. 
              You’ll also be using a little extra vanilla extract in the frosting.
              (2 teaspoons vanilla extract and
              1/4 teaspoon salt) 
          </p>
      </li>
  </ul>
